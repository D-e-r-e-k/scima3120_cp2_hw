I made a little racing game for the final project. You'll be driving a retro race car around a very basic track, the visual is inspired by F1 in the 50s. I used P5 for the project, and implemented a pretty interesting tire simulation to give the car a bit of realitic feeling in terms of handling. I tried to make use of everything avialable within P5, including it's vector support. To work with vetor and angular representations at first was a bit confusing but turns out pretty well. The hardest part I'd say is to descide how accurate I want my physics simulation to be, and make up physics when I want to keep it simple. It's a fun project and I enjoyed working on it a lot.
