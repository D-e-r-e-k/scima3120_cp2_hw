# Racing Game with P5
**Program what I like about motorsport and racing games/simulators into a game of my own**
## Summary
Ever since I was a little kid, I've been very into race cars. I've played many racing games, some racing simulators, followed all kinds of championships. Two aspects that I want to include in my game are the thrill of almost losing control, and practice really makes a difference. 

The format is probably going to be a top down racing game in P5. I'm not planning to explore adventurous way to implement the game, instead, how to make it as good as it can be within the limitation of my own skills.
## Components
- Vehicle physics simulation
- Visuals and animations
- Game mechanism

## Challenges
I think the main challenge would be how can I maximize the result from the limited time I have. Figuring out what are the areas that's worth spending my time and where should I go for the minimum viable solution.
## Timeline
Week1: Write proposal, research/experiment with simulation

Week2: Functional vehicle physics simulation prototype

Week3: Track and visual effect/feedback Sound

Week4: Game mechanism

Week5: Present
